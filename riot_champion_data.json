Spell: Zeri dashes a short distance and energizes her next 3 shots of Burst Fire, causing them to pierce through enemies. She will vault and grind over any terrain she touches. Spell: Zeri discharges a nova of electricity and overcharges herself, gaining increased damage and stacking Move Speed that refreshes and gets stronger every time she hits an enemy champion. While overcharged, Burst fire becomes a faster triple shot that chains lightning between enemies."
